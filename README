MAFW Metadata Receiver Example
==============================

This watches the MAFW Bus for metadata updates and prints them as they come in.
Requires: MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan (e.g. N950 or N9).

Build dependencies: libqt4-dev libqmafw-shared0-dev libqmafw0-dev

Historical note: This was the initial try at displaying "currently playing"
information in what later became Billboard. For the generic use case, it is
simpler to just read the "Media.NowPlaying" ContextKit property, but this
might still be useful in situations where you want to get detailed metadata.
